        Isolates

    <P>
        Most computers, even on mobile platforms, have multi-core CPUs. To take advantage of all those cores, developers traditionally use shared-memory threads running concurrently. However, shared-state concurrency is error prone and can lead to complicated code.

    <p>
        Instead of threads, all Dart code runs inside of isolates. Each isolate has its own memory heap, ensuring that no isolateâ€™s state is accessible from any other isolate.
